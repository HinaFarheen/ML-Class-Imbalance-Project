# ML-Class-Imbalance-Project
This repository contains a project on addressing class imbalance (CI) in machine learning models for the Machine Learning course. The project evaluates the impact of various CI techniques on model performance using multiple imbalanced datasets. It includes implementations of resampling methods, algorithmic methods, and data-level techniques. The repository contains Python scripts for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation, as well as datasets in both imbalanced and balanced formats. The final report is provided in PDF format, detailing the findings and analyses of the experiments.
## Project Overview:
This project investigates the impact of different techniques to handle class imbalance (CI) on machine learning performance. Class imbalance occurs when one class (minority class) is significantly underrepresented compared to another class (majority class), which can affect the performance of classification algorithms. The project explores various solutions to address CI, including resampling methods, algorithmic methods, one-class learning, and data-level techniques.
